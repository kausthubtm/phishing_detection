Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker,
masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link,
which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.
